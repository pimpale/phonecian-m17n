# Phonecian / Paleo-Hebrew m17n module

This is a [m17n](https://www.nongnu.org/m17n/) module for the Phonecian script.

The Phonecian script is the ancestor of the:
* Latin script
* Greek script
* Cryllic script
* Hebrew script
* Arabic script
* ... and many more!

In its heyday, the script was used for Phonecian, Paleo-Hebrew, Punic, and other ancient northwestern Semitic languages.

Unicode assigned all of them the same script block, [Phonecian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician_(Unicode_block)) (U+10900..U+1091F).
